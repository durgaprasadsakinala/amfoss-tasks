Do you have any feedback for the selction process?
A.) Yes, i think the selection process is nice and dicent. Intially i got scared by seeing the tasks but after start doing them, I think they are really good and challening.
   Before starting this tasks, i don't anything about programing. And now i had a small idea about python, c++ and java. And the main thing i learned from doing tasks is
   to 'learn from google and youtube tutorials', which helped me a lot in completing my tasks. I know that, I didn't completed all tasks but I tried my level best to join the
   culb and doing tasks.
